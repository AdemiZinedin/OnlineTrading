    <h1>Online Trading</h1>
    <h2>What does Trading mean?</h2>
    <p>In simple terms, online trading means nothing more than trading various financial instruments with the help of the Internet.
        Traders and investors buy and sell these instruments on an Internet-based trading platform offered by a broker or a bank.
         On this platform, the trader makes his decisions, which are immediately sent on to the broker, which is why an Internet connection is essential.
        Since the 1990s, online trading has been steadily growing in popularity, mainly due to the progress and better availability of fast computers and Internet connections. According to Moore's Law, computer power doubles every two years at the latest, which allows traders to trade online faster and faster and perform their own analyses on their own PC.</p>
